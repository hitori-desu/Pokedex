# a WPF implementation of a Pok√©dex

This was my final project for my second grade in HTL.

In hindsight im obviously not proud of this clusterfuck but eh who cares.

All sprites used in this Project belong to their respective owners (Gamefreak and Nintendo). 

I will never ever in my life write code this bad ever again.

Also my first time using an API!!! Pretty fun :D
